# Johnny Cakes
_Makes 8 to 10_

This recipe for these early-American pancakes comes to us from Richard Donnelly of Kenyon’s Mill in South Kingston, Rhode Island.

## Ingredients
* 1 cup stone-ground white cornmeal
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1½ cups boiling water Unsalted butter, for griddle

## Directions
Preheat an electric griddle to 380°, or place a griddle pan or large skillet over medium-high heat.

In a medium bowl, whisk together cornmeal, sugar, and salt. Add boiling water, and mix to combine. The batter will be thick. Using a tablespoon, drop the batter onto the griddle 2 inches apart for each johnny cake. Let cook for 6 minutes, turn and cook 5 minutes more.
