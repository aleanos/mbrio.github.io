# Salsa
## Ingredients
* 6 - 8 large Roma tomatoes (2 Lbs/1 Kilo) OR 1-28 ounce can whole tomatoes, drained
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
* 1 hot pepper
* ½ - 1 c (a handful) fresh cilantro leaves, to taste
* 1½ tsp salt
* ground pepper, to taste
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* ½ tsp ground cumin
* juice of one lime

## Directions
Steam tomatoes and chiles for a few minutes

Lightly saute onions and garlic

After blending ingredients, simmer on low for 15 minutes
Instructions

If using fresh tomatoes, add ½ inch of water to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Core and halve tomatoes and set them, cut side up, in the skillet.

While you dice the onions, simmer tomatoes until water evaporates and tomatoes start to soften. Peel and discard any skins that have loosened during steaming.
Toss tomatoes, hot peppers and cilantro into a blender container. Blend until smooth.

Heat 1 Tablespoon of oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onions and garlic in hot oil for about 10 seconds; just a flash in the pan.

Add blended tomato mixture to the skillet with the onions and garlic and give it a stir.

Season with salt and ground pepper to taste. Add cumin if desired.

Simmer on medium-low for about 15 minutes, or until salsa is reduced and thick.

You may need to increase cook time if tomatoes are very juicy.

You can add the juice of a fresh lime or lemon at this point, although it’s not necessary and will temper the salsa’s spiciness.

Serve with tortilla chips, enchiladas, tacos, scrambled eggs, etc.
