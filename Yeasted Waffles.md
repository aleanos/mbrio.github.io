# Yeasted Waffles
_From Lost Recipes by Marion Cunningham_

## Ingredients
* ½ cup warm water
* 1 package active dry yeast
* 2 cups milk, warmed 
* 8 tbsp (1 stick) butter, melted 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 cups all-purpose flour 
* 2 eggs
* ¼ teaspoon baking soda

## Directions
Use a large mixing bowl; the batter will rise to double its original volume. Put the water in the mixing bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Let stand for 5 minutes to dissolve.
 Add the milk, melted butter, salt, sugar and flour to the yeast mixture and beat until smooth and well blended. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand overnight at room temperature.
 Just before cooking the waffles beat in the eggs and the baking soda and stir until well mixed. The batter will be very thin. Pour about 1/2 to 3/4 cup batter into a very hot waffle iron. Bake the waffles until they are golden and crisp. 

Enjoy
