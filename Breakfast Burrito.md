## Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* 2 strips Bacon
* ⅛ Diced Sweet Potato

## Directions
Fry two strips of bacon in a pan. Once crispy, set aside on paper towels to cool. Leave a tablespoon of the bacon grease in the pan, discard the rest. Sauté an eighth of a diced sweet potato with one clove of garlic until tender. Push the potatoes to one side of the pan and scramble two eggs on the other. When the eggs are nearly done, add spinach and feta cheese to taste. Wrap everything in a gluten-free tortilla.
