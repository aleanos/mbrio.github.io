## Ingredients
* 1 large egg, beaten
* few dashes of hot sauce
* 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed but still cold.
* ⅓ cup parmesan cheese
* 2 tablespoons chopped chives
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
* coarse ground black pepper
* coarse sea salt

## Directions
Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

Unfold puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface and roll out just slightly.  The puff pastry should measure about 10×12-inches.

In a small bowl, whisk together egg, hot sauce, and a splash of water.  Brush the egg wash over the surface of the puff pastry.  Sprinkle pastry with cheese and herbs, coarse pepper, and a bit of salt.  Use the rolling pin to gently roll and press the toppings into the puff pastry.

Using a floured knife or pizza cutter, cut pastry lengthwise into about 1/2-inch strips.  Hold each end of the pastry and twist several times.  place the twisted pastry on the prepared sheet, about 1-inch apart.

Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, until puffed and golden brown.  You may want to take the baking cheese straws out halfway through baking to flip.  Allow to cool on the pan for 10 minutes before placing in a large glass to serve.

Cheese straws will last, in an airtight container at room temperature, for up to 3 days.  They’re really best within a day of baking.
