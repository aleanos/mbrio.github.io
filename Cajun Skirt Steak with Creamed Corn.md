# Cajun Skirt Steak with Creamed Corn
_Yields: 4 Servings_

## Ingredients
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 4 c fresh corn kernels (8 ears)
* 1 c half & half
* 1½ lbs skirt steak, cut into 2 pieces
* 2 tsp cajun seasoning
* 4 c mixed greens
* 1 c cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1 tbsp olive oil

## Directions
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the corn, half & half, ½ tsp salt, and ¼ tsp pepper and simmer until the corn is tender and the half & half is slightly thickened, 5 to 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat broiler. Season the steak with the cajun seasoning and a ¼ tsp each of salt and pepper. Place on a broiler proof rimmed baking sheet and broil for 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing.

In a medium bowl, toss the greens and tomatoes with the oil and ¼ tsp each salt and pepper. Serve with the steak and the corn.
