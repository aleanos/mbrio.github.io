# Daeji Bulgogi
## Ingredients
* 1 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed
* 2 tbsp brown sugar or Mirin
* 2 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
* 1½ tbsp sambal oelek
* 1 tbsp dark sesame oil
* 1 - 2 tsp minced peeled fresh ginger
* ½ tsp crushed red pepper
* 6 garlic cloves, minced
* Cooking spray (if using grill) or sesame oil (if using wok)

## Directions
Wrap pork in plastic wrap; freeze 1 1/2 hours or until firm. Remove plastic wrap; cut pork diagonally across grain into 1/16-inch-thick slices.

Combine pork, sugar, and next 6 ingredients (sugar through garlic) in a large zip-top plastic bag. Seal and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour, turning bag occasionally.

### Wok
Put some sesame oil in the wok, heat until just smoking. Remove pork from bag; discard marinade. You want as little liquid in the wok as possible because you’ll steam the meat instead of saute it. Saute pork until cooked. Do not over cook as the pork may become tough.

### Grill
Prepare grill.

Place a wire grilling basket on grill rack. Remove pork from bag; discard marinade. Place pork on grilling basket coated with cooking spray; grill 5 minutes or until desired degree of doneness, turning frequently.
