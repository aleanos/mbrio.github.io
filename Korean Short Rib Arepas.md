This was one of my favorite meals to prepare and consume! We served the arepas with baby bokchoy cooked in some of the reserved sauce from the short ribs.

## Ingredients
* Korean Short Ribs (External Recipe)
* Arepas (Follow Recipe on Masarepa)
* Vietnamese Daikon and Carrot Pickles (External Recipe)
* Chipotle Mayo (External Recipe)
* Scallions
* Sesame Seeds
* Sesame Oil

### Baby Bok Choy
* 2 tbsp Vegetable Oil
* 2 Garlic Cloves
* 1½ points Baby Bok Choy
* 1 tbsp Short Rib Sauce, plus more for final prep
* 1 tbsp Water
* ¼ Sesame Oil

## Directions
The night before begin the vietnamese daikon and carrot pickles recipe.

The morning begin cooking the korean short ribs.

30 minutes before eating prepare the arepas, chipotle mayo, and bok choy (recipe below)

When everything is complete put chipotle mayo on arepas, place short ribs on mayo, pickled carrots on short ribs, top with scallions and sesame seeds

### Baby Bok Choy
Heat vegetable oil in pan on medium high

Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds

Add the bok choy and, using tongs, fold it into the garlic mixture until coated.

Add the water and 1 tbsp short rib sauce, cover, and cook until steam accumulates, about 1 minute.

Uncover and cook until the greens are just wilted, the stalks are just fork tender but still crisp, and most of the water has evaporated, about 2 minutes.

Turn off the heat, stir in the sesame oil, and add as much short rib sauce as you’d like.
