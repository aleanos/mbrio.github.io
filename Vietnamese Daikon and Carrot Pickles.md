# Vietnamese Daikon and Carrot Pickles
_Yield: Makes approximately 5 pints._

## Ingredients
* 2 lbs carrots, peeled
* 2 lbs of daikon radishes, peeled
* 1 c plus 4 teaspoons of sugar
* 2 tsp salt
* 2Â½ c white vinegar
* 2 c warm water
* About 5 pint jars

## Directions
Julienne the carrots and the daikon radishes. Cut them first crosswise into 2 1/2 inch long segments. Then cut 1/4-inch thick slices lengthwise. Stack the slices and cut them again into 1/4-inch thick batons.

Place the carrots and daikon radishes in a large bowl. Sprinkle with 4 teaspoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of salt. Use your clean hands to toss the carrots and daikon with the salt and sugar until well coated.

Continue to mix the carrots and daikon with your hands until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. They are ready once you can bend a piece of daikon all the way over without it breaking.

Transfer the carrots and daikon to a colander, rinse with cool water and drain well.

Mix together one cup of sugar, the white vinegar and the warm water, until the sugar dissolves.

The pickles should sit at least overnight before eating; their flavor will improve with time. They should last 4 to 6 weeks in the refrigerator.
