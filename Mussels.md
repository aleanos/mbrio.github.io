# Mussels
## Ingredients
* 4oz butter
* 2 shallots, thinly sliced
* 2 c dry white wine
* 6 lbs mussels, scrubbed and debearded
* 4 sprigs of flat parsley
* salt and pepper

## Directions
Heat the butter in the large pot over medium-high heat. Once melted, add the shallots. Cook for 2 minutes, until the shallots are soft and just beginning to brown. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper.

Dump the mussels into the pot, and slap on the lid. Cook just until all the mussels are open all the way (about 10 minutes or more). Shake the pot, keeping the lid firmly pressed on top, then add the parsley and shake again.

You can toss in an additional knob of softened butter at this point, swirling it into the sauce for a nice, emulsified, enriching boost.
