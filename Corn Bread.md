# Corn Bread
## Ingredients
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup medium cornmeal
* 2 tablespoons baking powder
* 1½ teaspoons salt
* 1½ cups whole milk
* ½ pound unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* 2 extra-large eggs

## Directions
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the milk, melted butter, and eggs. With the mixer on the lowest speed, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones and stir until they are just blended. 

### For Iron Skillet
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F with cast iron skillet inside for 15 minutes.

Take pan out of oven and grease with butter.

Put batter in pan, and pan in the oven. Lower oven to 350 degrees F.

Bake for 30 minutes, until the top is crisp and a toothpick comes out clean. 

Cool for 15 minutes.

### For Muffins
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Spoon the batter into the paper liners, filling each one to the top. Bake for 30 minutes, until the tops are crisp and a toothpick comes out clean. Cool slightly and remove from the pan.

### Optional Topping
Melt butter in skillet on low and saute garlic until fragrant. Baste on top of cooked corn bread.
