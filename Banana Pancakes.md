## Ingredients
* 1 cup flour
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1¼ cups buttermilk
* 1 ripe banana, mashed
* 2 tablespoons melted butter
* ½ cup walnut pieces
* vegetable oil for frying

## Directions
In a medium bowl combine all of the dry ingredients.

Add the egg, buttermilk, banana and melted butter. Whisk them hard until it is completely combined well. Fold in the walnut pieces.

In a large heavy skillet over medium high heat, heat a thin layer of vegetable oil.

When the oil is hot, add the batter to the pan and cook 3-4 pancakes at a time, flipping them when they are golden brown on the edges and little bubbles form on the batter.

Stack them and eat them hot with butter, syrup and freshly sliced bananas.
