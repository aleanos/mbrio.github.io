# Bolognese Sauce
## Ingredients
* ½ - 1 Yellow Onion
* 2 - 4 garlic cloves
* 1 lb ground beef (85%)
* 3 hot Italian sausages (skin removed)
* 2 tbsp Olive oil
* Basil
* Oregano
* Salt
* Pepper
* 2 jars tomato sauce
* Red Wine (optional, use something you would want to drink, and drink leftovers while cooking)
* Parmigiana Regiano for plating
* 1 lb pasta

## Directions
Add olive oil to pan

Add onions and some salt to pan and sauté until they begin to soften.

Add garlic, let cook till fragrant (30 seconds)

Add ground beef, sausage, basil, oregano, salt, pepper to pan and sauté until cooked. If there is too much fat drain some out.

Deglaze with red wine.

Add two jars of sauce and simmer for 30 to 60 mins. If sauce looks like it’s getting to dry you can add water, or even better, more wine.

Add tomato sauce to pasta, and a generous helping of parmigiana!

Tip 1: As an alternative to the above you can swap out sausage with pancetta.
Tip 2: If you are not using hot Italian sausage (or if you want it spicier) you could use Arrabbiata tomato sauce.
