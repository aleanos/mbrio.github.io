# Minestrone Soup
## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 large onion, diced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 stalks celery, diced
* 1 large carrot, diced
* ⅓ pound green beans, trimmed and cut into ½-inch pieces (about 1½ c)
* Bag of spinach
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 1 28 -ounce can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
* 1 14 -ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 8 cups chicken broth (I usually 1 4-cup box of Kitchen Basics chicken stock and 1 4-cup box of Swanson chicken broth)
* 1½ lbs of dry beans or a 15 -ounce can low-sodium kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 cup ditalini pasta
* ⅓ cup finely grated parmesan cheese
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
* Delicious Italian bread

## Directions
If using dry kidney beans, place beans in pressure cooker covered in water and cook on high for 24 minutes. After 24 minutes allow to naturally de-pressurize.

Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds. Add the celery and carrot and cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the green beans, dried oregano and basil, ¾ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste; cook 3 more minutes.

Add the diced and crushed tomatoes and the chicken broth to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer.

If using dry kidney beans add the beans to the soup now.

While simmering, put on a pot of water for cooking the pasta. Boil pasta till it is just very al dente.

If using canned kidney beans; while the pasta water is boiling, after 10 minutes of simmering the soup, place the kidney beans into the soup.

Continue to simmer the soup till the pasta is done. I like cooking the pasta separately and storing it separately so it doesn’t get too mushy, especially for left-overs.

When you are about to drain the pasta, place the bag of spinach in the soup. Then drain the pasta.

For each individual plate place a big scoop of pasta at bottom of the bowl, pour soup over pasta, too with fresh basil and freshly shredded parmigiana.
