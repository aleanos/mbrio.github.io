## Ingredients
* 1 (16 ounce) package pasta shells, or similar shape
* 4 ounces prosciutto or pancetta
* 3 cups good-quality tomato sauce, I prefer this or Rao’s
* 1 (8 ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, chopped or pulled into bite-size pieces
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Directions
Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a large baking or casserole dish.

Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil and cook shells until al dente. Strain, reserving a cup of pasta water, and return the noodles to the pot.

Meanwhile, sauté the proscuitto in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp and golden brown. Let cool and crumble into small pieces.

Stir the prosciutto, tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and 1 1/2 cups of the shredded mozzarella into the cooked noodles. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour into prepared baking dish and top with the remaining shredded mozzarella and Parmesan. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until bubbling and light golden brown. Serve with garlic bread and a big green salad.

To reheat, cut the casserole into large squares. Pour about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of leftover pasta water into the seams and around the edges. (This allows moisture to steam the casserole instead of drying it out. The slices will “cook” themselves back together and the water will evaporate.)

Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350°F until hot and bubbly.
