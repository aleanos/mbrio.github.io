# Fluffy Pancakes
## Ingredients
* 2 c flour
* 4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted (2 tbsp extra for griddle)
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 4 tbsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 c milk or 3 c buttermilk

## Directions
Assemble your ingredients and equipment. Preheat oven to 200.

In the mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix with a whisk or mixer attachment.

Add the eggs, milk and cooking oil to the dry ingredients.

Mix until the ingredients are just combined. It’s OK if the batter is a little lumpy. You don’t want to over mix.

Heat your griddle or skillet over medium heat (set stove to 4 for dual skillet). Melt 1 some butter on the griddle.

Pour spoonfuls (1/4 c is a good size) of batter onto the griddle. Try to keep the pancakes between 2 and 3 inches in width and leave at least 1 inch in between. This batter is quite thick, so it won’t spread much once you pour it onto the griddle.

When you see bubbles begin to form on the top of the pancakes, it’s time to flip them.

The second side always cooks faster than the first, so they’ll probably only need a minute to finish cooking.

Place the finished pancakes on the oven-safe serving dish. Keep them warm in the oven while you cook the next batch.

Repeat the process until the batter is finished (adding the remaining butter to the griddle if necessary) and all the pancakes are cooked. Serve.

Top pancakes as desired and dig in. We like a little butter and some blueberry maple syrup (stay tuned for the recipe).

Repeat until pancakes are all eaten and bellies are full.
