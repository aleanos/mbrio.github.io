# Milk Buns
_Yield: 24-30 buns (the more the merrier…or divide everything by 3 for non-Hobbit appetite)_

## Ingredients
**Dough**: My mom says “Ummmm just use frozen dough. Don’t complicate it.” I don’t think she wanted me to destroy her kitchen, but you can absolutely create homemade dough, pretty much any recipe will suffice.

**Milk/Sugar Filling: (for approx. 3 loaves)**

* 1⅓ sticks butter or margarine
* 2 cups dried milk
* 1⅓ cups sugar

## Directions
Defrost dough overnight in fridge if using frozen dough.

Preheat oven to 200.

Combine filling ingredients and roll into golf ball sized balls; refrigerate until needed.

On a floured surface, roll out to stretch the loaves a bit and cut each loaf into 8-10 pieces, depending on the number of milk/sugar balls you just made.

Flatten each dough piece and create a deep well in the center; place a milk/sugar ball inside (avoid ball contact with the edge of the dough as the butter will prevent the edges from sticking together) and completely squish together the edges to envelop the ball.  Place seam-side down on greased cookie sheet.  Brush egg wash (1 egg + splash of water) over each bun.

In the 200 degree oven, turn OFF the heat and let the buns rise for 30 min.

Crank oven to 350.  Bake risen buns for 10 min. or until golden brown.

Nom nom!
