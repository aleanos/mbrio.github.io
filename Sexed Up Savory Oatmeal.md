## Ingredients
* steel cut oats or rolled oats
* olive oil
* flaky sea salt
* cracked pepper
* aged sharp cheddar (I used Jasper Hill Cabot clothbound aged cheddar, you could even go with a Parmigiano Reggiano)
* Additional toppings, poached or sunny-side up egg, sauteed veggies, or other savory ingredients to taste

## Directions
Follow directions for making oats. I normally bring 2 cups of water to a raging boil, add 1 cup of steel cut oats and lower heat to low. Cook slowly for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Oats are done when they are soft unless you prefer them more al dente.

Dish the oatmeal into bowls. The remaining ingredients are to your liking.

I start with the olive oil, add a 1/2 a tablespoon, maybe a pinch of salt, a few twists of crack pepper, and a shaving of cheese. Mix it all together and taste. Maybe add a little more oil, a pinch more of salt, pepper and cheese…mix…taste…I find that I add as I go with this dish.
