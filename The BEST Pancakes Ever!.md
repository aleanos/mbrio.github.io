# The BEST Pancakes Ever!
_serves 2 to 3 people_

## Ingredients
* 5 tablespoons of butter
* 1¼ cups flour
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* 1 egg, separated
* 1 cup buttermilk
* ¼ cup milk
* canola oil for frying

## Directions
Melt the butter and set aside to cool for a little bit.

Meanwhile, put the flour, sugar, baking powder and soda, and salt in a medium sized bowl and whisk to combine.

In another bowl, add the yolk from the egg and the buttermilk and the regular milk and whisk until well mixed. Add the butter and whisk.

Add the yolk and milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just barely combined.

Add the egg white and keep stirring until a thick batter is formed. Do not over mix.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat and film with a neutral oil like canola. When the
pan is hot, lower the flame a little and drop the batter by spoonfuls. The batter will spread. When bubbles break on the surface, peek underneath a pancake. It should be golden brown. If so, flip with a spatula and cook the other side.

Remove from the skillet when the second side is done and continue on with the remaining batter.

Hint: If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, you can use plain yogurt instead. Just use about 2/3 cup and thin it with some milk until it reaches the 1 cup mark.
