# Roasted Coffee Beans
![](Roasted Coffee Beans/2012-8-9%20(2).jpg)

I roasted another batch of beans tonight, I think I've nearly perfected my roasting technique in the oven. I've been roasting them in my convection oven at 500ยบ (auto reduced to 475ยบ for convection) for 30 to 50 minutes based on how dark of a roast I want. It seems they reach a new shade of color at around the 8 minute mark so I've been stirring at that interval. 30 minutes seems like a medium roast, 40 is medium-dark, I'm sure it's not too dark though so I'm reserving 50 minutes for dark.

I've come up with a technique for removing the husks, basically as soon as they come out of the oven I put them in a colander to begin cooling the beans off, I cover the top with aluminum foil or saran wrap, I go out in my backyard, and I shake like crazy. Worked very well. I then pack them in a freezer zip-lock bag.

Going to see how my medium-dark roast comes out today.
