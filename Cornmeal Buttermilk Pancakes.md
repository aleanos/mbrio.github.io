# Cornmeal Buttermilk Pancakes
_Bon Appétit | February 1998_
_Yield: Makes 10 pancakes_

## Ingredients
* ¾ cup unbleached all purpose flour ¾ cup yellow cornmeal
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* ½ teaspoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1¼ cups buttermilk
* 2 large eggs
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, cooled Vegetable oil

## Directions
Sift first 6 ingredients into large bowl. Whisk buttermilk, eggs and melted butter in medium bowl to blend. Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and whisk until blended and smooth.

Preheat oven to 300°F. Lightly coat bottom of heavy large skillet with oil. Heat over medium heat. Working in batches, pour 1/4 cup batter into skillet for each pancake. Cook until bottoms are golden, about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn pancakes and cook until second sides are golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to baking sheet; place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to skillet as necessary.

Melt some butter in maple syrup to drizzle over these slightly crunchy hotcakes.
