# Arroz y Caraotas Negras
## Ingredients
* 2 c Goya rice (not parboiled or converted)
* 3½ c chicken broth
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp oil
* 2 cans (15-16 oz. cans) black beans, drained
* ¾ cup cilantro, chopped

## Directions
Sauté the garlic in the corn oil until translucent.

Add the uncooked rice and sauté for another minute.

Add the chicken broth and salt. Stir and taste. Add more salt if you feel it needs it.

In another pot cook beans (maybe try adding some stock to the beans, I noticed the beans at Caracas bar had a meaty flavor to them).

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cover. Allow the rice to cook for 20 minutes on low heat.

Then turn the heat off and allow the rice to sit for another 10 minutes. During the cooking and rest time, do not uncover the rice.

Before serving, top with chopped cilantro.
