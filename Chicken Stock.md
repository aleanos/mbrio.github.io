# Chicken Stock
## Ingredients
* 2 lbs Chicken wings
* 2 Carrots
* 2 Celery stalks (optional)
* 1 Large Yellow Onion, skin on, cut in half **or** 1 to 2 bundles of scallion whites (reserve greens for in soup) and 1 shallot, skin on, cut in half
* 1 2” Ginger Knob, skin on, cut in half (optional)
* 1 Garlic head, skin on, cut in half horizontally
* 4 Sprigs of Thyme (optional)
* 1 Handful Parsley (optional)
* 2 Bay leaves (optional)
* 1½ tsp black pepper corns
* 2 quarts of cold water (all ingredients should be submerged)

## Hardware
* 	Large Pressure Cooker (mine is 8 quart) (optional)

## Directions
_If not using a pressure cooker you may want to rough chop the carrots, celery, onions, and ginger to extract more flavor._

Place all ingredients in a pressure cooker or large stock pot.

**Pressure cooker:** Heat on high pressure for 30 minutes then, carefully, manually release pressure.
**Stock pot:** gently simmer for 1½ hours.

Strain large items with a colander.

Strain smaller bits with a fine mesh sieve.

_The chicken is really good to eat if you are using wings, you can pull it apart from the bones when they cool and serve them in another chicken soup, in this soup, or make a chicken salad._

## Notes
If I am using this in a Japanese soup, such as Ramen or Soba, I will usually substitute the onion with scallions and a shallot and leave out the celery, thyme, bay leaves, and parsley.
