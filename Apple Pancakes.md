## Apple Pancakes
### Ingredients
* 1½ c flour
* 1½ tsp baking powder
* ¾ tsp baking soda
* ¼ tsp salt
* ½ c superfine sugar
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 egg
* 1 c buttermilk
* 2 apples, peeled and grated
* 1 tsp butter

### Directions
Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl and make a well in the center.  Beat the egg and the milk together and pour into the well. Using a wooden spoon, gently incorporate the dry ingredients into the liquid until well combined, then stir in the grated apple.

Heat the butter in a large nonstick skillet over low heat until melted and bubbling.  Add tablespoons of the pancake mixture to form 3 ½ inch circles. Cook each pancake for about 1 minute, until it starts to bubble lightly on the top and looks set, then flip it over and cook the other side for 30 seconds, or until cooked through.  The pancakes should be golden brown; if not, increase the heat a little. Remove from the skillet and keep warm. Repeat the process until all of the pancake batter has been used up.
