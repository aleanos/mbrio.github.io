# Angel Biscuits
## Ingredients
* 1 package dry yeast (about 2¼ teaspoons)
* ½ cup warm water (105° to 115°)
* 5 cups all-purpose flour
* ¼ cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ½ cup vegetable shortening
* 2 cups low-fat buttermilk
* Cooking spray
* 1 tablespoon melted butter
* Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl; let stand 5 minutes.

## Directions
Combine the dry ingredients (flour through salt) in a large bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add yeast mixture and buttermilk; stir just until moist. Cover and chill 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Turn dough out onto a heavily floured surface; knead lightly 5 times. Roll dough to a 1/2-inch thickness; cut with a 3-inch biscuit cutter. Place on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Brush melted margarine over biscuit tops. Bake at 450° for 12 minutes or until golden.
