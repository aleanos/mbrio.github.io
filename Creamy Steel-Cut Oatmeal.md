## Ingredients
* 1 teaspoon butter or olive oil
* 1 cup steel-cut oats
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 3 cups water
* 3-fingered pinch salt
* 1 cup milk (optional)

## Directions
Start this the night before you want to have steel-cut oatmeal. Measure out your oats. This quantity will make about 4 servings.

Heat about 1 teaspoon butter or olive oil in a 2-quart saucepan set over medium heat. Add the oats and fry them for about 3 minutes, or until they start smelling toasty.

Pour in the water and add the salt. Stir.

Bring to a rolling boil.

Turn off the heat and cover the pan. Leave it on the stove, and go to bed!
