We absolutely love this recipe!

## Ingredients
* 1 c Soy Sauce
* 1 c Mirin
* 16 Garlic Cloves, Minced
* 4 tbsp Dark Brown Sugar, Packed
* 4 tbsp Rice Vinegar, Unflavored
* 4 tbsp Sesame Oil
* 4 tbsp Ginger Root, Minced
* 2 tbsp Toasted Sesame Seeds
* 2 Large Green Onions (Scallions), Chopped
* 5 lbs Short Ribs

## Directions
Mix Soy Sauce, Mirin, Garlic, Brown Sugar, Rice Vinegar, Sesame Oil, and Ginger Root in a bowl with a whisk. Put Short Ribs in Crock Pot on High for 6 hours or Low for 9 hours; or use a Dutch Oven and cook at 250 for 6 to 7 hours.

Serve over rice with a sprinkling of sesame seeds and green onions (scallions).

Note on Crock Pot cooking: I normally cook it for 6 hours on Low then finish it off on High, maybe another 2 to 3 hours. When done it should look very dark.
