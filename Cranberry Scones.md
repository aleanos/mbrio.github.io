# Cranberry Scones
_Yields: 8 Scones_

## Ingredients
* 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface
* 5 tablespoons sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for topping
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
* ⅔ cup (plus 1 tablespoon) half-and-half
* ½ cup halved cranberries, drained on paper towels

## Directions
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

In a bowl, whisk together flour, 5 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 2/3 cup half-and-half until just moistened. Gently fold in cranberries.

On a lightly floured surface, knead dough gently, 5 to 10 times. Pat into a 1-inch-thick round. Cut into 8 wedges; place on a baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Brush tops with remaining tablespoon half-and-half; sprinkle with remaining tablespoon sugar.

Bake until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack.
