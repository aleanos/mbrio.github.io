## Directions
### Dashi
Place two pieces of kombu in cold water and let sit for 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes bring to a boil, take out kombu just before it boils, add bonito flakes and turn the heat off. Let stand for 1 minute, then pour through a fine mesh sieve.

### Tare
Combine all ingredients and stir.

### Chicken Stock
Place all ingredients in a pressure cooker.

Cook at high pressure for 30 minutes.

Take off heat and depressurize.

Strain out big chunks

Strain through fine mesh sieve.

_The chicken is really good to eat, you can pull it apart from the bones when they cool and serve them in another chicken soup, in this soup, or make a chicken salad._

### Garlic & Ginger Chicken
Preheat oven to 450º with a cast iron or steel frying pan in the oven.
On a cutting board put salt, ginger, and garlic. Chop until you have formed a paste. Rub paste all over chicken breast.

When oven is at full temperature take pan out, place on stove at medium-high heat. Put oil in pan, once shimmering (nearly instantly) place the chicken breast, skin side down, in it. Cook until skin is browned. Turn chickens over and place the pan back in the oven for about 20 minutes (you want an internal temperature around 162º to 165º). Take chicken out and let sit for at least 5 to 10 minutes (the temperature will continue to rise while resting, so you may want to err just under 165º).

Cut meat off of bone, and slice it to be placed into the soup.

### Mushrooms
Heat olive oil and butter in skillet on medium heat.

Add shallots and cook until they begin to soften.

Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds.

Add mushrooms and begin to cook (do not add salt as this prevents mushrooms from getting crispy). Butter is good, if it looks like you need more butter, add it now. You should raise the heat to medium-high.

Cook mushrooms until they begin to brown and most if not all moisture has been released and evaporated. Add a dash of fish sauce (or Worcestershire sauce), salt and pepper. Continue to cook until sufficiently browned and some mushrooms are crispy.

_It is absolutely important to cook these mushrooms until most if not all of the moisture has been released and evaporated; there should be no water in the pan, and the mushrooms should not feel spongy. If your mushrooms are spongy, they need to be cooked more._

### Soba Soup
Combine dashi, tare, and 2 cups of chicken stock.

Bring just to a boil, serve hot.

While soup is heating up boil a package of soba (or ramen noodles). When done, drain and rinse with cold water.

## Plating
Place cooked noodles in empty soup bowl. Pour soup over noodles. Place pees, mushrooms, and garlic & ginger chicken on top of noodle bed. Place scallions on top of everything. Optionally place a light dusting of togarashi.
