# The Original Hurricane
## Ingredients
_makes 1 cocktail_

* 2 oz dark rum
* 1 oz passion fruit syrup
* 1 oz fresh-squeezed lemon juice

## Directions
Combine all ingredients in a shaker over ice. Shake and strain into an ice-filled glass. (The original recipe calls for crushed ice, but I prefer this with cubed, since the drink doesn’t get diluted as quickly.) Garnish with an orange slice and cherry.

So what if you want to make a whole pitcher of hurricanes? I’m glad you asked.

Combine all ingredients, including the ice, in a pitcher. Stir to mix the ingredients. Allow to sit for at least 15 minutes before serving to allow the ice to melt into the drink. Prepare for a good party.
